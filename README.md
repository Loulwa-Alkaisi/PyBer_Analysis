# ***Total Fares by City Type.***
## PyBer_Analysis_Challenge
### **Overview**

This analysis is created to show the ride-sharing data refering to each city type and create a line graph that will show the total weekly fares for each city type, which will help V. Isualize to easily see the differences between each city type.

### **Results**
Our data compares three city types based on five categories. The categories are total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The rural city type shows the following data: 
Total Rides = **125**
Total Drivers = **78**
Total Fares = **$4,327.93**
Average Fare per Ride = **$34.62**
Average Fare per Driver= **$55.49**
We can notice that the rates are high. The data for the suburban city type shows cheaper rates:
Total Rides = **625**
Total Drivers = **490**
Total Fares = **$19,356.33**
Average Fare per Ride = **$30.97**
Average Fare per Driver= **$39.50**
Lastly, the urban city type data shows the cheapest rates with the most total fares:
Total Rides = **1625**
Total Drivers = **2405**
Total Fares = **$39,854.38**
Average Fare per Ride = **$24.53**
Average Fare per Driver= **$16.57**

The graph below does a great job at showcasing the data on a weekly basis:

### **Summary**

Based on our data we can say that the most profitable city type is the urban city type. The reason behind that is that even with having the lowest rates with an average rate per ride of **$24.53** and the average rate per driver of **$16.57** it is still more profitable than the other two types with a total fares of **$39,854.38**. Additionally, the data tells us that the more drivers and rides we have the more profit we'll generate at lower fares.
